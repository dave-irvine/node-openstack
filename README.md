# node-openstack

Node.js bindings for the OpenStack API.

## Should I be using this?

Probably not. See [pkgcloud](https://github.com/pkgcloud/pkgcloud) for something a little more provider agnostic.

## What is this for then?

I couldn't get pkgcloud to work the way I wanted and I had a deadline with no time to understand pkgcloud's code layout to submit pull requests.
